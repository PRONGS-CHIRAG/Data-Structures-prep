Other Important Points.

Pointers are used to access multi-dimensional arrays.
Multi-dimensional arrays are also referred to as array of arrays.
Sparse matrices are matrices which contain a large amount of 0's.
Sparse Matrices are of two types- Lower triangular ( above main diagonal every element is zero)
                                  Upper Triangular ( below main diagonal every element is zero)
Applications Of Arrays
->Used in databases
_>Used to implement other data structures
->Used for sorting elements
->Used for representing vectors,matrices and other mathematical formulae.
